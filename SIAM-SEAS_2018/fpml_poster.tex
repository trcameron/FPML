{
We present a novel modification of Laguerre's method that results in a method for the concurrent approximation of all roots of a univariate polynomial. Our method has strong virtues including fourth-order convergence that is observed in practice and belonging to the class of embarrassingly parallel algorithms. A Fortran 90 implementation of our algorithm is available online and comparisons with several other software are provided to show the effectiveness of our approach.
