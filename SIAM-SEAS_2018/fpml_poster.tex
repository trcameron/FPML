{
We present a novel modification of Laguerre's method that results in a method for the concurrent approximation of all roots of a univariate polynomial. Our method has strong virtues including fourth-order convergence that can be observed in practice and belonging to the class of embarrassingly parallel algorithms. A Fortran 90 implementation of our algorithm is available online and comparisons with several other software are provided.

	{
		Let $p(\lambda)=a_{0}+a_{1}\lambda+\cdots+a_{m}\lambda^{m}$ be a polynomial with $a_{0}a_{m}\neq 0$ and denote by $(z_{1},\ldots,z_{m})$ the current approximations to the roots of $p(\lambda)$. The $j$th approximation is updated via
		\begin{equation}
		\hat{z}_{j}=z_{j}-\frac{m}{G_{j}\pm\sqrt{(m-1)(mH_{j}-G_{j}^{2})}},
		\end{equation}
		where 
		\begin{equation}
		G_{j}=\frac{p^{'}(z_{j})}{p(z_{j})}-\sum_{\substack{i=1\\i\neq j}}^{m}\frac{1}{(z_{j}-z_{i})}~\text{ and }~H_{j}=-\left(\frac{p^{'}(z_{j})}{p(z_{j})}\right)^{'}-\sum_{\substack{i=1\\i\neq j}}^{m}\frac{1}{(z_{j}-z_{i})^{2}}.
		\end{equation}
		On each iteration, $z_{j}$ is updated for $j=1,\ldots,m$, unless it was accepted on a previous iteration.
		
	\textbf{Initial Estimates.} In essence, we select complex numbers along circles of suitable radii. What constitutes suitable radii is formalized in~\cite{Bini1996} and can be computed via the upper envelope of the convex hull of the set $\{(i,\log|a_{i}|),~i=0,1,\ldots,m\}$. We compute the convex hull via Andrew's Monotone Chain algorithm~\cite{Andrew1979}.
	
	\textbf{Backward Error.} The backward error of an approximate root $\xi$ is given by
	\begin{equation}
	\eta(\xi)=\frac{|p(\xi)|}{\alpha(\xi)},
	\end{equation}
	where $\alpha(\xi) = \sum_{i=0}^{m}|e_{i}||\xi|^{i}$ and $e_{i}$ represent tolerances against which perturbations are measured. We accept a root approximation $\xi$ if $\eta(\xi)<\mu$, where $\mu$ is machine precision. 
	
	\textbf{Condition.} The condition of a nonzero approximate root $\xi$ is given by
	\begin{equation}
	\kappa(\xi)=\frac{\alpha(\xi)}{|\xi||p^{'}(\xi)|}.
	\end{equation}
	If the root approximation $\xi$ is accepted, then we also return its condition.

	\textbf{Convergence.} Here we test the convergence of the roots of three polynomials. The first polynomial is $z^{5}-1$, the second is the degree $10$ Chebyshev polynomial, and the third is $z^{10}+\cdots+z+1$. The error is measured as the maximum relative forward error. For each polynomial, the error after each iteration is recorded in the table below.
